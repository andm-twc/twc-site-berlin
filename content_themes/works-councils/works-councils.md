<h1>Works Councils</h1>

As Tech Workers Coalition, we support the formation of Works Councils as a means to organize and gain collective power within your workplace. Below is some basic information on the German system of Works Councils (Betriebsr√§te). If you'd like to learn more or have plans to initiate a campaign at your workplace, please get in touch or join us in our next general meeting. Please be aware that this it not legal advice.

<h2>Training</h2>

We host Works Council training sessions every two weeks, including an introduction to the German Works Council and union system and the possibility to discuss strategic questions and formal considerations of a Works Council campaign. We aim to provide an open forum and safe space to share experiences and learn from each other.

Please check the [Events](/events) section for upcoming times and registration form.
