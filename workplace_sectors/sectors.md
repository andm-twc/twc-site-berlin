For strategic reasons you may want to organize along **sectoral** lines. The following list is in no way authoritative or sole way to organize. Rather this list should serve as inspiration of what's happening and what's possible. If you would like to suggest improvements, including missing sectors or companies, please let us know!

 - [Amazon](/sectors/amazon)
 - Platform Workers
 - Fintech (financial technology)
 - [Property Tech and Gentrification](/sectors/gentrification)
 - [Video Gaming](/sectors/gaming)
